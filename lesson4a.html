      <h3>It's gonna be a mix up of games based on my personal preferences.<br>Some games are story focused for a single player<br> and some games are online only multiplayer.

        <h4><u>Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice</u></h4>

      <img class="photo" src="C:\Users\HP\Documents\Foundations 2023\FITC 130_Web Development and Coding\Code\Website\images\sekiro.jpg" alt="Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice Cover Art"></u>
        <p>Sekiro Shadows Die Twice is a single player experience unlike any other featuring some of the tightest best feeling combat on the market. If you wanted to feel like a skilled shinobi fighting for your life in medieval Japan, 'Sekiro' will throw you right into the expereince. </p>

          <p>The sound design really stands out insantly in this game as the clashing of steel during sword fights is almost unforgettable and incredibly satisfying to hear, this game at its core is a combat centered expereince and it does combat <strong>very, very well.</strong> </p>

            <p>This game is for people with fast reflexes and it defintiely poses a challenge to the players, it makes you feel like a shinobi but not without first showing you defeat over, and over, and over. You WILL die a lot, but once this game *clicks* for you, you will feel unbeatable.</p>

              <h1>In Conclusion:</h1>

              <p> The <b>gameplay</b> is amazingly tight, in a battle where every milisecond counts there's no delay in inputs, it does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do. The <b>world building</b> is amazing although somewhat liniar. The feel of the world is dark and bleak and the characters are very memorable. There isnt exactly an open world to discover but the level design is beautiful when it wants to be, for a game with a linar point a to point b progression the design is still very intricate and the exploration is still enjoyable and visually stunning.<br>
                What can I say, the <b>graphics</b> are beautiful even without it being a "next-gen" title and really leaves nothing to be desired in my opinion. Sekiro features one of the prettiest final boss arenas I've seen in a "souls" game.<br>
                The <b>writing/story</b> isnt the strong suit in this game and it frankly doesn't impact what this game accomplishes. While the story is present and I actually like it a lot, I think there could have been a <em>tiny</em> bit more to it and yet im not upset about it either. <b>So is it fun?</b> Absolutely.</p>

<center><h1>This next game is a contender for <strong>best game ever made</strong> in my opinion and I'm being completely honest..</h1></center>
<h3> This game won <abbr title="Game Of the Year">GOTY</abbr> in 2022 and has been universally praised by critics and fans alike. It's truly a game I wish I could go back in time to experience all over again for the first time.. <br>
  <h1> And the game is..
<h4><u> Elden Ring </u></h4>

  <img class="photo" src="C:\Users\HP\Documents\Foundations 2023\FITC 130_Web Development and Coding\Code\Website\images\elden-ring.jpg" alt="Elden Ring Cover Art">
<p> I'd like to preface this game chat with the fact that in this day and age, the world of gaming has expereinced some major set-backs. For many big name companies and developers releasing unfinished products or games riddled with micro-transactions meant to extract more money out of the consumers became the norm. Gone were the days of a complete game filled with content for around $60. Keep in mind inflation has been at play and a full priced game is now over $100CAD so when we hard working people spend a whopping $100 dollars, many of us <b>EXPECT</b> a finished & polished game without having to spend more to "unlock" additional content.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately even today this isnt always the case, many of us have to research the games we want extensively and wait weeks to a month after its released to see the game for what it really is. It's true, <em>good</em> games are few and far between.</p>

    <p><u>Elden Ring</u> released by veteran development studio "From Software" hit the shelves in 2022 and immedietly took the world by storm. A dark fantasy adventure RPG taking place in perhaps one of the most expansive fully open world evironments ever created. Not only was the enviroment vast but the world has extensive cave systems littered throughout the map, entire cities underground and even castles in the sky, of course their own unique enemies.</p>

      <p> Something incredible that Elden Ring accomplishes is that they DO NOT tell you how to play their game.. <em>They just let you play it.</em> It sounds simple yet it's uncommon in a lot of games.. You can go just about anywhere from the very beginning and this game does not hold your hand. From Software is known for their games difficulty and this game is no different, challenging and epic boss fights are something this studio do perfectly.</p>

        <h1>In Conclusion:</h1>

        <p>The <b>gameplay</b> of this game is simply incredible when you take into account just how many weapons there are, many having their own unique attacks and styles. The sheer amount of customizability in this game is incredible and everything <em>just works..</em>The <b>worldbuilding</b> in Elden Ring is like no other I've ever expereinced and not just due to its sheer size. The landscape is full of verticality and life, its caves and dungeons are intricate and full of secret pathways, this world tells a story all on its own and the <abbr title="Non Player Character">NPC's</abbr> feel bursting with life and their own stories.</p>

          <p><b>Graphically</b> this game is outstanding, the exploration alone is amazing but paired with how <em>incredible</em> it all looks is unbelievable. This game is <b>SO</b> pretty you really have to stop and take it all in. Something I didnt mention for the previous game but I have to mention here is the <b>soundtrack</b> in this game is incredible.. The way this game paints a story with thematic soundstracks is a work of art.</p>

            <p>It's impossible to summarize how truly deep the lore and story of this game go, the <b>writing/story</b> isnt surface level in Elden Ring infact it kind of has to be <em>searched for..</em> Through the text descriptions of items and other characters conversations we learn the story of the world we inahbit. With mutliple "quest lines" the player can follow each having their own unique ending and story line, YouTube creators have literally created MOVIE length breakdowns and dramatizations of the plots created in game. Part of the reason for this is "Game of Thrones" writer George RR Martin had a hand in writing a good chunk of the main quest line story for Elden Ring.. Yeah, let that sink in for a bit. So finally, <b>is it fun?</b> Do I even need to answer? not only is it fun, its an entire expereince packed into ONE complete game for a one time price. This is what the <b>standard</b> for gaming should be.</p>

  <h1> Moving on to a game a bit different from the others, this game isnt meant to be a single player expereince and there is no main quest!</h1>
    <h3>This video game is an online multiplayer team based shooter, its classified as a "battle royale" meaning a big number of players and teams all compete to be the last team standing. This game requires skilled gameplay mechanics, accurate communication between team mates, and a good general knowledge about the game. It's easily a cut above the others on the market and this game is FREE to play.</h3>
    <h1>We're talking about-</h1>
    <h4><u> Apex Legends </u></h4>

    <img class="photo" src="C:\Users\HP\Documents\Foundations 2023\FITC 130_Web Development and Coding\Code\Website\images\apex-legends.jpg" alt="Cover art for Apex Legends">

    <p> Apex Legends is one of many battle royal games on the market competing with famous games like "Call of Duty" and "Fortnite" and of course share similarities to these games in the sense that they're the same genre of game, other than the genre this game is in a league of its own. Apex Legends is a first person shooter built upon a large series of characters known as "legends" each with their own unique abilities, these abilities add a layer of strategic uses for a teams common goal of survival. The legends unique abilities can be used in many ways adding to the unpredictability of each game forcing players to continue to innovate and be creative to adapt to situations.</p>

      <p>The main thing setting Apex Legends apart is the extremely tight, and very fast paced movement. The game works hand in hand with carrying momentum and its done so well you can <em>feel</em> the weight behind it. The game is filled with something players call "movement tech" which is specific inputs done within a matter of frames in a second that let you instantly gain momentum in any direction, because of this the skill ceiling in this game is <b>very high.</b> The result of the skill ceiling unfortunately is it can be difficult for new players to compete with someone who knows the game and its mechanics well and that would be my main gripe with this game.</p>

        <p> The developers do a decent job with listening to the community and releasing updates fairly often which is amazing but thats not to say they haven't made mistakes, to combat new players struggling the developers implemented "Skill Based Match Making" also known as "SBMM" in an attempt to group new players with new players and vets with vets and on paper the plan is perfect but the plan falls short. New players tend to be filtered out quickly due to the high demands of this game mentally, and mechanically.</p>

        <h1>In Conclusion</h1>

          <p><b>Gameplay</b> wise this game is unbeatable, the fluidity of movement and its refined gunplay and implementation of unique legend abilities all works flawlessly together. This game genuinely ruined other first person shooters for me, nothing can even come close to the fluid and responsive movement, as well as precision of gunplay. <b>Graphically</b> this game is very strong, the colours are bright and divserse, the character models look amazing, and the whopping 4 large maps to play on are all unique and beautiful. The <b>world building/writing/story</b> in this game is unique because it does actually have a story, the developers release monthly comics telling stories of the legends and whenever a new character is released they have their own intro video and their origin story is told, known as "Tales from the Outlands" and they are very impressive.</p>

          <p> Though the story is not a main point it still very much exists and through these stories is how they build their world. While not a main point in the game, it exists and thats cool because in my opinion a game like this doesnt need a story at all. <b>Is it fun?</b> It's absolutely a blast if you can get past the learning curve and competative nature of this game. Ive put thousands of hours into this game and I still look forward to playing with friends to this day.</p>
